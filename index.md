# Transcending Mental Models
<!--**A Relevant Research Series workshop prepared by [Brian Southwell](https://www.rti.org/expert/brian-g-southwell), Senior Director of Science in the Public Sphere at the Research Triangle Institute.**-->

Brian Southwell, Senior Director of Science in the Public Sphere at the Research Triangle Institute, delivers a two-part workshop series on translating research for audiences beyond the university. In particular, Southwell focuses on understanding how social and political opinions are formed and reformed. Audiences are not blank slates, but bring their own mental models - thoughts, ideas, opinions, experiences - to the conversation.

By the end of this workshop series, participants will be able to: 

1. Explain how people form social and political opinions, and the implications of these mental models on knowledge mobilization

2. Identify potential partnerships with media professionals

3. Identify and address misinformation or misperceptions about their research

Proceed to the first [video](video-1) to get started.
